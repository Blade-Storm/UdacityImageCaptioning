# Udacity Image Captioning

## Project Overview

This project is the second project from from Udacity's [Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891). 


The project will be broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks:

`Notebook 0: Dataset` Initialize the COCO API to obtain the data

`Notebook 1: Preliminaries` Explore and use the Dataloader to obtain batches, Experiment with the CNN Encoder, and Implement the RNN Decoder
